**Comprehensive Project Analysis Report: Deep Learning Model Comparison Study**

---

### **1. Executive Summary**

This project conducted a systematic comparison of eight convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for binary image classification. The study evaluated ResNet variants (50,101), VGG variants (16,19), DenseNet variants (121,201), MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet-B0, focusing on performance metrics, computational efficiency, and practical deployability. Key findings revealed multiple models achieving perfect classification scores (100% accuracy), significant variations in inference speeds despite parameter counts, and unexpected efficiency patterns challenging conventional architectural assumptions.
