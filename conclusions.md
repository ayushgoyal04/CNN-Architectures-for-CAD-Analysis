**Title: Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Coronary Artery Disease Detection Using Medical Imaging**

**Abstract**
This research aims to evaluate and compare multiple deep learning models for coronary artery disease (CAD) detection using medical images. The study examines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, including ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large, NASNetMobile, and EfficientNetB0, to determine the most effective model for identifying CAD from labeled medical images. The models were assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curves. Our results provide insights into the most optimal architectures for CAD detection.
